<p style="font-size: 25px">FIRST Robotics Teams 2052 (KnightKrawler) and 2472 (Centurions) are once again hosting a week zero event!</p>

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <p class="center"><b>Please note the new location!</b> We are very excited to bring the event to Irondale High School this year!</p>

    <p>
      <a href="/glossary/#pok">POK</a> has created a wooden version of the field, and we will be running a full day mock competition with it.
      These matches are intended to provide teams an opportunity to see how their robot interacts with field elements and other robots.
      Aggressive play (including robot-to-robot contact) is not allowed without prior consent from the other teams in your match. Climbing
      will be allowed on the field this year. There will be no set match schedule; teams will sign up for play slots on the fly. We will
      make every effort to give each team equal play time.<br>
    <br>
      We will offer unofficial robot inspections by trained inspectors (including a trained Lead Robot Inspector) and matches will be run
      by a trained FTA. We will also have a number of other trained volunteers present, including a game announcer! There will be no referees
      at the event, and we will not be tracking scoring.
