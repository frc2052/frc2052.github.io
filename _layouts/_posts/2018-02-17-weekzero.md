We will be building the team version of the field, which is constructed primarily out of wood, and will be running a full day mock competition. These matches are intended to provide teams an opportunity to see how their robot interacts with field elements and other robots. Aggressive play (including robot-to-robot contact) is not allowed without prior consent from the other teams in your match. Climbing (if applicable) may not be allowed on the field. There will be no set match schedule; teams will sign up for play slots on the fly. We will make every effort to give each team equal play time.

We will offer unofficial robot inspections by trained inspectors (including a trained Lead Robot Inspector) and matches will be run by a trained FTA. We will also have a number of other trained volunteers present, including a game announcer! There will be no referees at the event, and we will not be tracking scoring.

KnightKrawler will also be webcasting the event. Stay tuned for a link to the webcast!
