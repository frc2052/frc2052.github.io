                    The <a href="https://www.pololu.com/product/4022" target="_blank">Romi Robot Kit by Pololu</a> is a
                    small form factor robotics kit that allows a small, inexpensive robot to be
                    programmed using the same <a href="https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/romi-robot/index.html" target="_blank">Java based WPI Lib codebase</a> FRC students use for programming the large
                    competition robots. The Romi Kit is a ready-to-go driving
                    platform that gives students the ability to quickly start a brand-new project and get up and running
                    with robot code. However, the platform is very limitted in its
                    out-of-the-box features.

                    KnightKrawler has started an initiative to build representative robots based on the Pololu Romi
                    platform. This includes robots that have intakes and shooters.
                    The KnightKrawler platform only requires the Romi control board and motors, which can save
                    money, rather than buying the whole kit. Our first robot model is called Ragnar.

                                    Any FDM 3D printer should be capable of making this robot. While the Prusa is a
                                    high-quality printer it certainly is not required.
                                    The models were designed to have minimal or no supports and work with a large
                                    nozzle. These models were printed with a
                                    <a target="_blank"
                                        href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&tag=team2052-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=7845260b5be0f362762b9be031d4858a&camp=1789&creative=9325&index=aps&keywords=0.8mm extruder brass nozzle">0.8mm
                                        nozzle.</a>
                                    Larger nozzles and layer heights dramatically reduce print times, but do reduce
                                    the detail in prints. As such, some bolt holes may need to be
                                    drilled out depending on your printer settings that may extrude extra filament
                                    causing overflow, making the holes smaller than designed. When
                                    purchasing larger nozzles, ensure you are buying the correct type for your
                                    printer and verify your slicer software has a profile for the nozzle size you
                                    are purchasing.
                                    The models were designed for fast/large layer heights, however you can print them with your standard nozzle size (usually 0.4mm) and slicer settings.
                                </p>

                                    PLA Filament was used for these prints, but PETG would also be a fine choice.
                                    PLA is an easy to print, low cost filament. However PLA lacks the strength
                                    and heat tolerance of other filaments. If you plan to travel with your robots in
                                    a hot car, you may want to choose PETG to avoid warping due to heat. Other filaments
                                    such as ABS or Nylon
                                    will offer superior heat and strength tolerance at greater cost. Some more
                                    advanced filaments may require printing in an enclosure and suffer from slight
                                    shrinkage, which could affect the fit of the parts.

                                    When buying jumper wires, we recommend both 10cm and 20cm jumper wires. The 10cm
                                    wires work well for connecting the drive motors to the Romi board,
                                    however the longer jumper wires will work fine if you already have them and don't
                                    mind tying up the extra length.
                                    As you connect mechanisms to the top of the robot, having a collection of the longer
                                    20cm jumper wires will be helpful.
                                </p>
                                <br />

                                    While many robotics teams may have a large collection of small ANSI sized nuts and
                                    bolts, it is easier to find assortment packs of metric sized nuts and bolts.
                                    3mm (also referred to as M3) is a very common size for small fasteners used in 3D
                                    printing projects, so KnightKrawler has opted to use this size for our primary
                                    fastener.
                                    Feel free to substitute fasters of a comparable size that works for you. All of the
                                    parts are made to work with any pan head or cap head bolt.
                                    None of the parts in the current designs are designed to work with countersunk or
                                    V-set bolts.

                                    Blue thread locker is a cheap and easy way to secure nuts onto bolts. However if you
                                    don't like thread locker because it is too messy or
                                    find it doesn't work well, you can purchase <a target="_blank"

                                    The Romi board includes screws holes that are too small for M3 bolts. For this
                                    assembly, we use M2 screws. By using screws, It makes it possible to remove the
                                    electronics without disassembling significant parts of the robot. Be sure to
                                    purchase screws that are actual screws with a point, not machine
                                    screws that have bolt threads.

                                    Check the Pololu Romi documentation. At the time of assembling these instructions,
                                    the supported models of Raspberry Pi were 3B+ and 4B. Our robots
                                    work with 3B+, which is also a lower cost model.

                                    There are many options for powering your Romi. The Romi requires only 5-6V to power the boards and drive the robot. However, in testing we have found closer to 12v works better if you
                                    plan to control other mechanisms such as a shooter or pickup mechanism. Most servos require 5V and many small toy car motors require 6V-24V. KnightKrawler has opted to use three 18650 Lithium-Ion 
                                    batteries. This provides about 12V of power when fully charged. In testing, we found that running a shooter motor and two servos at the same time was possible with 12V. However at 7-8V, the Raspberry Pi
                                    would "brown out" resulting in a reboot. The 18650 batteries provide flexibility for charging batteries in multi-bank chargers. You may also want to consider using battery packs 
                                    made for RC cars. These battery packs come in a variety of shapes and voltage outputs and generally simplify charging.

                                    There are many options for wire connectors to use for your wire to power your Romi and Raspberry Pi. If you plan to use RC Car Battery packs, select the connector type that will work with your
                                    battery packs. Otherwise, select a connector type balances size and ease of use when connecting and disconnecting your batteries.

                                    If the square drive peg does not have a snug fit on the motor shaft, use a small piece of a rubber band
                                    to create a tight fit.
                                    Place the rubber band over the hole, then press shaft into the hole. Make sure to
                                    properly align the flat side of the shaft.
                                    Push the square drive peg
                                    on to the shaft so approximately 1-2mm of space remains between the motor and square
                                    drive peg.
                                    Trim the rubber band as short as possible after shaft is inserted.

                                    Axels can but cut a variety of different ways. A hacksaw with a vice is a solution many robotics teams may have. A more portable solution is to use a

                                    Additionally, cutting axels can leave a sharp end. To round the end to avoid cuts to your skin or snags inside the 3D printed parts, 
                                    the ends can be sanded with metal sandpaper, or a

                                    Different print quality can impact the size of axel holes. Axels should slide easily into parts, and wheels should spin freely on the axel. 
                                    It may be necessary to use a drill and small drill bit to enlarge holes if they are too snug.

                                    If bolts are too long and extend too far into the body of the robot, it may impact mechanisms mounting on the base. You may decide to 
                                    reverse the bolts, so the extra length of the bolt is towards the outside of the wheel frame, rather than extending into the robot body. Alternatively,
                                    the lineman's pliers can be used to trim the bolt length after the nuts are installed.

                                    Pin headers come in long strips and can be snapped between the pins to obtain the desired pin header length. 
                                    Pin header jumper caps are an easy way to hold multiple rows of pin headers together when soldering. In this photo, the pin headers for the PWM pins have been connected using 4 jumper caps.                                    
                                </p>

                                    Modeling clay can be used to hold the pin headers in place while placed upside down on the Romi board. When soldering, do not place the solder on the tip of the soldering iron, but rather use 
                                    the soldering iron to heat the pin and connector on the board. Touch the solder to the pin and board to complete the weld. Electronics solder include a material called flux, which cleans the 
                                    connection. If solder is placed on the soldering iron, the flux does not do its job of cleaning the parts to be connected. Note: Some modeling clay may melt if too much heat is transferred through the pin
                                    into the clay. It may be necessary to use a toothbrush, or other bristle brush, to clean off the header pins if the clay melts to the pins.

                                    The Romi board includes a convenience strip of standard PWM connections for running additional motors or servos for future mechanisms. However the 5v power bus is not connected by default.
                                    Use a header jumper cap to connect the 5V pin adjacent to the signal pins, to the middle pins of the PWM connections.

                    Romi Subsystems are similar, but control mechanisms unlike those usually found on a real FRC robot. Currently, the Romi attempts to control PWM motor controllers that use a single locked-antiphase PWM signal. 
                    These motor controllers are often large and/or expensive. 
                    Low cost PWM motor controllers (also called an "H-Bridge") typically used on RC cars cannot use this signal. Instead they need an anolog (voltage) signal for forward, and a second signal for reverse. Unfortunately, the Romi does not allow for 
                    analog out. So the only option is a Digital Out signal. This is effectively either 0% or 100% voltage.

                <p>
                    The TL;DR; includes 3 complete subsystem classes for the intake, shooter, and indexer. Copy these classes to avoid needing to figure out how control servos and H-Bridge motor controllers from scratch. You may need to modify the package name to match 
                    your project.
