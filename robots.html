    Sorry for the delay. Interviewing the robots has been more challenging than we expected.
    We will have something posted here just as soon as we get our Steamworks robot to come
    back down to the floor. Our Aerial Assist robot is also wound a little tight, it may
    take some time to get it to concentrate on the 2014 season.
