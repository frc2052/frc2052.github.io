    This year, KnightKrawler students developed a <b>Mini Robot building and programming</b> lesson.
    The goal of this project is to show students how <b>easy it is to create a simple robot</b>.
    We also wanted the project to be something <b>students can easily create from home</b>.
    These robots are <b>cheap to build</b> (the battery is a portable phone charger!) and are programmed in <b>Python</b> on a <b>Raspberry Pi</b>.
    Below are links to instructions on creating these robots:
