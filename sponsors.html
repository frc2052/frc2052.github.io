            <h2 class="text-center maroon">Our Team Depends on You!</h2>
          </a>
          <p>
            When you offer financial support to KnightKrawler Robotics, you are not just supporting 50
            high school students who like to play with robots.  You are helping to create the next
            generation of engineers, software developers, business leaders, and entrepreneurs.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Your contributions are tax deductible.</strong> KnightKrawler Robotics has been a 501c3 charity since 2009.
            We operate as a booster club to manage the FRC Robotics Team for Irondale High School.
          </p>
          <p>
            It likely comes as no surprise, but schools today lack the funding to fully finance most after-school
            activities.  In fact, <strong>less than 10% of our budget</strong> comes from Irondale High School.
            Most of our funding comes from sponsors like you, as well as students' activity and travel fees (donations).
            How much does it cost to run KnightKrawler? Our required annual budget is usually between <strong>$50,000 and $75,000</strong>,
             depending on team size and if we qualify for the championship tournament in Houston, Texas (we have the past eight years).
            All coaches and mentors participate on a purely volunteer basis. The high school provides a paid Team Advisor.
          </p>
          <p>
            How do we spend your sponsorship dollars?
            <ul>
              <li>Reduced travel expenses for two out-of-town tournaments a year</li>
              <li>Robot parts</li>
              <li>Tools</li>
              <li>Computer hardware and software</li>
              <li>Camera equipment</li>
              <li>Practice field construction</li>
              <li>Costs associated with public & school robot demonstrations</li>
              <li>Student assistance Scholarship Fund</li>
              <li>Insurance</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            In total, supporting KnightKrawler isn’t just about supporting 50 students in a
            single high school. <strong>We work to introduce robotics to hundreds, perhaps thousands of
            kids each year.</strong>  Your money helps to fund an introduction to kids who would never
            consider a future in technology before seeing high school students who could build robots.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Our team strives for great diversity.</strong> We know that many companies like to promote inclusion in
            the initiatives they support. Some of our past and present members have described robotics
            as “a place where I fit.”  High school can be a difficult place for many kids, and we pride
            ourselves on making robotics a place where everyone is welcome. We would love to have you
            come to one of our meetings and see for yourself how well we meet our goals of inclusion.
            This year we have 48 registered students.

            <!-- These stats should be updated probably yearly/every other year if possible -->
            <ul>
              <li>Female team captain</li>
              <li>20% of our members are female</li>
              <li>28% of Irondale students qualify for educational benefits (2024 data)</li>
              <li>29% of our coaches/mentors are female</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            KnightKrawler Robotics is not an elite program for rich kids, as some might think.
            Not all our students have the financial means to participate in after-school activities.
            Travel fees for all students are optional to all competitions in the midwest and financial travel assistance is
            available for travel to World Championships in Houston, Texas this year.
            We uses sponsorship dollars every year to cover the travel fees
            for those who can’t afford to pay the full activity fee or travel costs.
            <strong>We don’t want anyone to miss out on the benefits of robotics for financial reasons.</strong>

            <li class="footnote">Single color black logo. Must receive sponsorship and logo artwork before January 10th</li>
            <li class="footnote">
              A visit may not be possible for some sponsors who require travel, or if
              desired dates conflict with other robotics or school events. We will do our best to
              accommodate a sponsor's requested visit date, such as attending a company picnic to maximize our impact.
              However, we cannot guarantee a demonstration to all companies. If a team visit is critical to your sponsorship decision,
              please let us know about your interest in a visit before becoming a sponsor.

              Single color black or white logo. Logos will be placed on the robot in compliance
              with competition rules. Unfortunately, in 2018, we were forced to remove the logos.
              The robot weight limit was 120lbs.  Our robot with the logo decals removed weighed 119lbs and 15ozs.
              The logos have been added back to the 2018 robot for all demonstrations and promotional photos.
              We will do our best to put our sponsor logos on the robot for competition.
