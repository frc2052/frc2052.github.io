          </a>
          <p>
            When you offer financial support to KnightKrawler Robotics, you are not just supporting 40-50
            high school students who like to play with robots.  You are helping to create the next
            generation of engineers, software developers, business leaders and entrepreneurs.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Your contributions are tax deductible.</strong> KnightKrawler Robotics has been a 501c3 charity since 2009.
            We operate as a booster club to manage to the FRC Robotics Team for Irondale High School.
          </p>
          <p>
            It likely comes as no suprise, but schools today lack the funding to fully fund most after
            school activities.  In fact, <strong>less than 10% of our budget</strong> comes from Irondale High School.
            Most of our funding comes from sponsors like you, as well as students activity and travel fees.
            How much does it cost to run KnightKrawler? Our required annual budget is usually between <strong>$50,000 and $75,000</strong>
            each year, depending on team size and if we qualify for the championship tournament in Detroit (we have the past 5 years).
            All coaches and mentors participate on purely volunteer basis. The high school provides a Team Advisor.
          </p>
          <p>
            How do we spend your sponsorship dollars?
            <ul>
              <li>Reduced travel expenses for two out-of-town tournaments a year</li>
              <li>Robot parts</li>
              <li>Tools</li>
              <li>Computer hardware and software</li>
              <li>Camera equipment</li>
              <li>Practice field construction</li>
              <li>Costs associated with public & school robot demonstrations</li>
              <li>Student assistance angel fund</li>
              <li>Insurance</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            In total, supporting KnightKrawler, isn’t just about supporting 50 students in a
            single high school, <strong>we work to introduce robotics to hundreds, perhaps thousands of
            kids each year.</strong>  Your money helps to fund that introduction to kids who would never
            consider a future in technology, until they saw high school students who could build robots.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Our team has great diversity.</strong> We know that many companies like to promote inclusion in
            the initiatives they support. Some of our past and present members have described robotics
            as “a place where I fit.”  High school can be a difficult place for many kids and we pride
            ourselves on making robotics a place where everyone is welcome. We would love to have you
            come to one of our meetings and see for yourself how well we meet our goals of inclusion.
            This year we have 48 registered students.
            <ul>
              <li>Female team captain</li>
              <li>30% of our members are female</li>
              <li>27% are non-white</li>
              <li>10% are in special education</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            KnightKrawler Robotics is not an elite program for rich kids, as some might think.
            Not all our students have the financial means to participate in after school activities.
            That is why KnightKrawler uses sponsorship dollars every year to establish an Angel Fund
            to help those who can’t afford to pay the full school activity fee, or cover travel costs.
            <strong>We don’t want anyone to miss out on the benefits of robotics for financial reasons.</strong>

              A visit may not be possible for some sponsors who require travel, or if

              However we cannot guarentee a demonstration to all companies. If a team visit is critical to your sponsorship decision,
