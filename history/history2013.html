          <p class="text-center gameDescription"> Throughout the season the team worked hard on perfecting a secret weapon that we didn't utilize until a critical finals match- full court shooting from one end of the field to the other. The frisbies it shoots have to be caught with two hands because of how fast they spin. With its mecanum wheels and short stature, this robot was nimble and hard to pin down, just like the silverfish we occasionally find in our build space." </p>

          <p class="text-center gameDescription"> This game starts off with a 15 second autonomous period where robots are controlled autonomously. Robots control 11 inch Discs and score them in goals on the opponent’s side of the field. There are three goals above the opposing alliance’s drivers stations; the middle one is worth one point more than the other two. Another goal to one side of those drivers stations, closer to the ground. The final goal, and the one worth the most points, is at the top of that alliance’s Pyramid. In Endgame, robots score by climbing their Pyramid and are rewarded points depending on which level they climb on.
