          <p class="text-center gameDescription"> This game starts off with a 15 second autonomous period where robots are controlled autonomously. In the remaining 2:15, drivers take control of the robots. Robots control Power Cells (seven inch diameter dodge balls) and score them in either the Power Port’s Lower, Outer, or Inner goals located at the opposing alliance’s wall. Alliances progress through three stages to activate the Shield Generator. The first one requires scoring nine power cells. Stage two is completed when twenty additional power cells are scored and a spinner called the Control Panel is spun three to five times. Finally, the third stage is activated when another twenty power cells are scored and the Control Panel is spun to a specific color. In Endgame, robots hang on the Shield Generator Switch and attempt to level it to score points.
