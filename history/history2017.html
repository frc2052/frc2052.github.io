              <li> Our secret weapon on this robot was our rope that allowed us to put our climbing mechanism in the center of the robot. It allowed for a very easy climb. </li>
              <li> The only time our shooter worked consistantly was at our very last off-season competition. </li>
              <li> Our practice bot was named Phil Collins because some of the members of KnightKrawler were obsessed with "In the Air Tonight" at the time. </li>
              <li> Out of the 40 matches Hornet competed in during the season, it successfully climbed 37 of those times. </li>
              <li> The robot got its name "Hornet" because the gear holder looked like a hornet head and it also had wings for the airship davit. </li>

          <p class="text-center gameDescription"> This game starts off with a 15 second autonomous period where robots are controlled autonomously. In the remaining 2:15, drivers take control of the robots. Robots control Fuel, (wiffle balls), and/or Gears, (11 inch round gears). They score Fuel in either a low or high goal in their team’s Boiler. Gears are put onto a peg of the Airship in the center of the field. Human Players (Pilots) inside the Airship lift up Gears and place them to turn four Rotors. Each Rotor requires an increasing amount of gears to be engaged. In Endgame, robots score points by climbing on ropes attached to the Airship.
