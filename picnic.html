                We are still on! Rain is coming, but it may not storm until the last half of the picnic. We will strive to have the charcoal grills going by 5:45pm.
                The facility has a full kitchen with an industrial electric stove with 4 burners. We are bringing a pot for boiling hotdogs and a pan for anything else.
                If the rain makes grilling out of the question, we will fallback to the kitchen.
                Bring a raincoat. Stay until the weather makes us leave.

            <h2 >Picnic Q&A</h2>
            <p><strong>Do I need to RSVP?</strong></p>
            <p>
                No. We have reserved a shelter that has a 100 person capacity, and there a dozens of nearby picnic tables. It would be 
                great to let us know you are coming just so we know who got our message, but it is not necessary. You are welcome to come last minute.
            </p>
            <p><strong>How does food work?</strong></p>
            <p>
                Since there isn't an RSVP, the best way to plan for food, including dietary restrictions, plates and drinks, is to bring what you need to feed yourself or your team. 
                You have the option of combining your food with others for a potluck, or keeping it with your team. 
                Pizza and soda works, it is robotics after all.
                KnightKrawler will provide charcoal for the park grills.
                We hope students and mentors will grab their team food and find some new people to sit with.
            </p>
            <p><strong>What activities are planned?</strong></p>
            <p>
                We will be at a park with a lake, but there is no beach and no swimming. There are some spots for shore fishing if you want to throw out a line. 
                In previous years students hang out at the playground, play sand volleyball or ultimate frisbee. 
                This year maybe the right year to start a kickball tradition. Feel free to bring yard games or table-top games. 
                We did not pay for a music permit and have been warned not to play music from our shelter.
            </p>
            <p><strong>What should I wear?</strong></p>
            <p>
                Team shirts.
            </p>
            <p><strong>What if it rains?</strong></p>
            <p>
                Unless there is a big storm, we will still meet. Watch this webpage for updates if the weather looks iffy.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Does the whole team need to come?</strong></p>
            <p>
                In past years we had one team represented by a single student. That is awesome. Bring as many or as few as you like. Recently graduated seniors are welcome.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Should we bring our robot?</strong></p>
            <p>
                No. There won't be a place to drive a competition bot.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Why isn't it on a weekend?</strong></p>
            <p>
                We get an awesome deal through the county if we reserve a weekday. Plus, we don't want to interfere with graduation parties.
            </p>
            <p><strong>What if I have more questions?</strong></p>
            <p>
                Email info@team2052.com. We will add to this page as more questions come in.
