      <strong>Instead of the normal FRC game and season, teams were given three challenges to complete. One of the challenges was
      the Game Design Challenge. This challenge is to design and create our own FIRST FRC game, with an additional
      challenge to include a chain in the game's design. KnightKrawler designed the game <i>Maritime Mayhem!</i> during the
      two months we had between kickoff and submission.</strong>

        <h1 class="text-center maroon">Game Overview</h1>
        <p>
          The factory on the shore is dumping plastic bottles into the ocean, harming the wildlife! In Maritime Mayhem, diving robots are deployed
          to rescue animals, gather plastic bottles, and power their ship so they can set sail to the next cleanup location!
        </p>
        <p>
          Robots start against the alliance wall and can be preloaded with up to one Animal, either a Turtle or a Duck. The game starts off with a 15
          second autonomous period. Robots earn points by passing the Auto Line, pressing Wind Turbine buttons, and rescuing Turtles and Ducks by placing
          them into the Animal Sanctuary.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the 2:15 teleoperated portion of the game, Robots collect plastic dispensed from the Factory and rescue Animals. Bottles and Jugs are
          reintroduced to the field via Human Players through the Factory. They are put onto the field as more Bottles and Jugs are scored. Animals are
          not reintroduced to the field. Turtles and Ducks start near the factory and become covered over time with the plastic dispensed from the factory.
          Bottles and Jugs are scored into goals located on each alliance’s Ship. There is a low goal in the Cargo Bay located on the Ship’s deck. Two
          high goals are located on the Ship’s wall. Teams can also recycle plastic bottles into the Factory’s recycling slots. The alliances race to
          be the first to recycle ten Bottles into the Factory. Turtles and Ducks need to be rescued from the polluted site around the factory and placed
          into the Animal Sanctuary in their respective habitats. Ducks are placed into the water and Turtles are placed on land. They can also be scored
          in the Animal Sactuary’s lake section. The Wind Turbines in the two halves of the field are used to power the alliance’s Ship to replace energy
          produced by the factory. There are two Wind Turbine phases, and bonuses are earned for their completion.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the 30 second Endgame, robots climb aboard their ship to set sail to the next location. They can park on the Ship Deck, climb the Cargo
          Net, or scale one of the Ropes to earn points. The alliance that earns the most points wins the match!

          Robots can drive up the ramps on either side of the Ship to reach the
          Ship Deck and score Bottles and Jugs into two three foot high goals on the back of the Ship. Another goal, called the Cargo Bay, is on the floor at the
          front of the Deck. At the end of the match, Robots can climb the Ship Ropes that drop down from the Ship wall or Cargo Nets to the right and left sides of the Ship.

          Wind Turbines are in the middle of each alliance’s half of the field. The Turbine’s cylindrical base contains three buttons separated by walls. Once
          each button has been pressed, the Turbine activates, completing Phase 1, and starts spinning. Phase 2 is completed when robots press two buttons on
          their Turbine simultaneously, causing the Turbine to spin faster.

          The Animal Sanctuary is in the middle of the field against the audience sidewall. It’s a three-tiered semi-circle where robots can place Turtles and
          Ducks. The bottom level represents an Ocean, the middle represents Land, and the upper represents a Lake. Alliances earn more points when placing an animal on its correct
          habitat; the Turtles’ natural habitat is the Ocean, and the Ducks’ natural habitat is the Land. Placing either animal into the Lake earns the maximum number of points.

          causes the Factory to stop producing smog (a fan stops blowing grey streamers into the air). </p>

        <h1 class="text-center maroon">Robot Actions and Points</h1>
        <p>
          Robots control two types of animals - Turtles and Ducks - and two types of plastics - Bottles and Jugs. The Animals are rescued to be scored in the
          Animal Habitat. Turtles are scored in the bottom ocean section and Ducks are scored in the middle land section. If scored correctly, six points
          are earned; if scored incorrectly, three points are earned. If either Animal is scored in the top Lake section, ten points are earned. Bottles and
          Jugs are taken from the Factory and scored into the Ship. Scoring them in the top two goals above the deck earns three or ten points for Bottles
          and Jugs respectively. Scoring into the bottom goal located on the Ship Deck earns one point for Bottles and two for Jugs. The first alliance to
          recycle ten Bottles into the Factory earns 20 points.
        </p>
        <p>
          Robots can also interact with the Wind Turbine. Two Wind Turbines are located in the middle of each half of the field. There are two phases, and
          each of the three buttons can be pressed once per phase for five points. When Phase 1 is completed, the alliance earns 20 points. If Phase 1 is
          completed in Auto, the alliance earns one ranking point. Phase 2 of the Turbine is only available when both alliances complete Phase 1. Completing
          the second phase earns the alliance 30 points.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Endgame, Robots go back to their ship for points. Scaling the Cargo Net located on the sides of the Ship earns the alliance 25 points. Robots
          that climb the Ropes hanging from the Ship wall receive 10 points. Finally, five points are earned for parking on the Ship deck. If the game
          ends with one robot on each endgame spot, that alliance earns a ranking point.
