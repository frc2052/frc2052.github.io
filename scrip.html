            <p><strong>Since 1994, Scrip has helped families raise over $680 million for more than 48,000 organizations across the country.</strong><p>
            <p>Scrip is a fundraising opportunity in which regular gift cards can be purchased and the team receives a portion of the face value amount – a rebate – from the company or business that provides the gift cards. All funds raised from Scrip will be put into your child's robotics account, which can be leveraged to pay for robotics related fees and costs.</p>
            <p>The Scrip program has gift cards for just about any store, restaurant, or business; many where you may already shop, like Cub Foods, Home Depot, Menards, Chipotle, iTunes, Walmart/Sam's Club, Kohl's, Target, Best Buy, etc.  The cards cost you no more than their face value; meaning if you buy a $100 card to Cub Foods, you pay $100 for it, and it is worth $100 at Cub Foods.  <strong>You lose nothing in the transaction.  The individual companies and businesses offer a rebate back to us for a portion of the card's face value.</strong></p>
            <p>For example, you order a $100 Cub Foods card and pay $100 for the card, but Cub gives a 4% rebate back to the team, so the card only costs our team $96.  That remaining $4.00 goes into your child's fundraising account.  Other retailers and businesses have different rebate amounts, and sometimes they give bonuses too.  The highest rebate seen so far is 12%, but there could be some higher ones as well.</p>
            <p class="maroon pt-5"><strong>REMEMBER: All rebate proceeds from the sale/purchase of Scrip will be attributed to your student's activity fund.  Keep in mind that this fundraiser is optional; however, it is being made available to you to help defray costs incurred as part of the team's normal operation.</strong></p>

            <p><a href="https://shop.shopwithscrip.com/About/WhatsNew/2016/October/1973/low-denoms-available" target="_blank">Lower denomination gift cards<a> are offered by many stores and retailers, which may make good gifts. You can access more by going to the <a href="https://www.shopwithscrip.com/" target="_blank">ShopWithScrip</a> site and selecting the "$10 and Under Gift Cards" category on the left side. There are also <a href="https://www.shopwithscrip.com/" target="_blank">gift card wrappers</a> available if you are planning on giving gift cards as gifts.</p>
            <p class="maroon"><strong>Warning:</strong> Some businesses offer electronic Scrip Cards (ScripNow!) and card reloading along with the traditional plastic cards, so be careful to pick the type of cards you intend to order.  The different types are usually split up into categories, 'Physical', 'ScripNow!', and 'Reload'.  If you want regular plastic cards, make sure you are ordering cards from the 'Physical' category.</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Amazon's 'Physical' cards are made of heavy cardstock, not plastic. They are also a bit larger than traditional plastic cards, about the size of an index card.</p>
            <p><strong>Please either complete your Scrip order online (at <a href="https://www.shopwithscrip.com/" target="_blank">http://www.shopwithscrip.com</a>) or let us know what you would like to order (it's preferable to make orders online but we can make it work either way).  All payments will be due upon receipt of your cards. You can pay by check (payable to KnightKrawler Robotics), or you can set up "Presto Pay" on the Scrip site to automatically and electronically pay when you place your order.</strong></p>
