        KnightKrawler has an "official" season that starts at <a href="/glossary#infonight">Information Night</a>
        and ends after our last competition.  The last competition could be a regional in March or April if the
        team fails to qualify for Championships (late April) or the State Tournament (mid-May).
        </p>
        <p>
          We officially meet 11 months of the year.  The mentors attempt to take a one month break for most of June.
          Optional meetings are typically held 1-2 days per week in the summer where students can work on special projects.
          These include, but are not limited to, building a new drive mechanism the team has not tried before, or programming an <a href="/glossary#autonomous">autonomous</a> routine.
          The team also does various outreach activities during the summer that students are encouraged, but not required, to attend.

              During the offseason we attend <a href="/glossary#minnemini">Minne Mini</a> and
              <a href="/glossary#mri">the Minnesota Robotics Invitational</a>. These take place
              in the fall and use the previous season's game to introduce new students to FIRST Robotics.

              We also attend two regular-season competitions in Minnesota; the Northern Lights Regional in
              Duluth and the Minnesota 10,000 Lakes Regional in Minneapolis. If we qualify for
              <a href="/glossary#champs">FIRST Championships</a> we take a trip to Detroit, Michigan in April.
              We can also qualify for the Minnesota state competition, which is in May.

              While robotics is a large time commitment, it is possible to participate in other activities.
              Fall and Spring activities typically work best with the robotics season. Our Build Season is
              in January which makes it very difficult to do a winter sport/activity and robotics. Also, robotics
              meetings start later in the night, at 6:00 pm, so clubs and other activities right after school can work.
