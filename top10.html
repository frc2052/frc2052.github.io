          1. Pay Attention to Sandstorm
        </strong>
      </h4>
      <p class="big_indent">
        During the <strong>first 15 seconds of every match</strong>, shutters are lowered, blocking driver visibility of the field. Drivers are required to either control their robot while viewing <strong>live camera footage</strong> or run it off <strong>pre-programmed code</strong>. Keep an eye out for robots that score cargo (balls) and hatch panels (disks) during Sandstorm— this can give teams a head start before the teleoperated (full driver visibility) portion of the match.

          2. Robots Can Score Match Points and Ranking Points
        </strong>
      </h4>
      <p class="big_indent">
        <strong><u>MATCH POINTS</u></strong>
      </p>
      <p class="big_indent pl-3">
        During Sandstorm, robots can earn points for <strong>crossing the “HAB Line,”</strong> and earn even more if they
        started on a platform off the ground. Robots also attempt to score <strong>balls called “cargo”</strong> (3 points)
        and <strong>disks called “hatch panels”</strong> (2 points). Another way to earn match points is by
        <strong>climbing</strong> the HAB platforms during the last 30 seconds of the match (12 points for level 3, 6 points
        for level 2, and 3 points for level 1). <strong>The alliance with the most match points when the match ends wins!</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="big_indent">
        <strong><u>RANKING POINTS</u></strong>
      </p>
      <p class="big_indent pl-3">
        Ranking points determine a team’s <strong>overall place</strong> in the qualification matches. They can be earned by
        <strong>completing a rocket ship</strong> (see number 3), receiving <strong>15 HAB climb bonus points</strong> in endgame,
        and <strong>winning</strong> or <strong>tying</strong> a match.

        <strong>
          3. Look For Completed Rocket Ships
        </strong>
      </h4>
      <p class="big_indent">
        If a rocket ship has <strong>6 hatch panels and 6 cargo</strong>, it is considered completed. A completed rocket ship
        counts for one ranking point.

          4. Some Robots Can Climb
        </strong>
      </h4>
      <p class="big_indent">
        If an alliance has robots on the <strong>first and third</strong> platforms or <strong>two on the second and one on the
          first</strong>, they earn a ranking point. They also earn match points for climbing, which can help them win the match.

          5. Two Alliances Made of Three Teams Each Play at Every Match
        </strong>
      </h4>
      <p class="big_indent">
        Two alliances play in every match: <span style="color:red">red</span> and <span style="color:blue">blue</span>.
        <strong>Each alliance during qualifications contains three randomly-selected teams.</strong> After qualifications, the
        top eight ranked teams choose alliances to compete with for eliminations.

          6. Teams Can Receive Penalties That Award Points to the Opposing Alliance
        </strong>
      </h4>
      <p class="big_indent">
        There are six penalties a team can make during a match. Usually, a referee will wave his or her flag to signal a penalty.
        Depending on the type a penalty, <strong>referees will award a certain number of match points to the opposing
        alliance</strong>.

          8. The Scoreboard Can be Confusing. Here’s What You Need to Know:
        </strong>
      </h4>
      <p class="big_indent">
        <strong><u>TEAMS</u></strong>
      </p>
      <p class="big_indent pl-3">
        Numbers and icons of <strong>teams</strong> are shown on the side as well as their <strong>rank</strong> and whether they went <strong>up or down</strong> in the ranking.
      </p>
      <p class="big_indent">
        <strong><u>TOTALS</u></strong>
      </p>
      <p class="big_indent pl-3">
        The <strong>total score</strong> of each alliance is conveyed in the middle, and it specifies which team won. <strong>Ranking point totals</strong> are
        shown in the bottom corners. There are icons below the totals symbolizing the different ways to earn a ranking point,
        and if the icons are highlighted, the team has scored that point.
      </p>
      <p class="big_indent">
        <strong><u>POINT BREAKDOWNS</u></strong>
      </p>
      <p class="big_indent pl-3">
        At the bottom of the scoreboard, <strong>point breakdowns</strong> are shown. This specifies points for <strong>each section of the game</strong> as well
        as penalties of the other team. These points are <strong>added up</strong> for each <strong>team’s total score</strong>.
      </p>
      <p class="big_indent">
        In <strong>Quarterfinals</strong> and later, the scoreboard looks slightly different, as shown in the right image. <strong>Ranking points are not
        counted in these matches</strong>, so the bottom corners will only show the trophy icon. <strong>Individual team ranking is also not
        recorded</strong>, so the ranking next to the team is not there.

          9. Visit the Pits to Chat With Teams and Collect Buttons
        </strong>
      </h4>
      <p class="big_indent">
        The pits are the area where teams keep their tools and work on their robots in between matches. If you want to check them out, ask your student to show you the way. <strong>Don’t forget to pick up a pair of safety glasses at the entrance!</strong> Also, most teams will give out buttons at their pit, so you can start a collection.

          10. Cheer With KnightKrawler!
        </strong>
      </h4>
      <div class="big_indent">
        <p>
          KnightKrawler cheers are used in the stands. One person will lead them, usually the mascot, and you can follow along! When you hear the words, respond with the <b>bold</b> ones.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>20! <b>52!</b></li>
          <li>Let Me Hear You Holler! <b>KnightKrawler</b>!</li>
          <li><b>Deep Down in Robotics Jungle You Can Hear KnightKrawler Rumble: Hoo Ha… Hoo Ha!</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We have cheers aimed at the entire alliance as well, not just our team. This is cheered in the same rhythm as the “let’s go (team)” cheer in baseball.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Red Alliance *five claps*</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In addition to these cheers, KnightKrawler likes to cheer for our alliance partners, especially in eliminations. These cheers will be the same as KnightKrawler’s “2052” cheer, but with the other team’s numbers instead of ours.
