          1. Pay Attention to Autonomous
        </b>
      </h4>
      <p class="big_indent">
        During the <b>first 15 seconds of every match</b>, drivers are required to keep away from the drivers stations as their
        robots drive with <b>pre-programmed</b> code. This year, robots start the game on the <b>opposite end of the field from
        their driver stations</b>. Keep an eye out for robots that score all their power cells (balls) during autonomous — this can
        give teams a head start before the teleoperated (driver controlled) portion of the match.

          2. Robots Can Score Match Points and Ranking Points
        </b>

      <p class="big_indent">
        <b><u>MATCH POINTS</u></b>
      </p>
      <p class="big_indent pl-3">
        During Autonomous, robots can earn points for <b>moving from the "Initiation Line.”</b> At all times during the match,
        robots attempt to score <b>balls called “power cells”</b> into the Power Port located at the opposite side of the
        field. Teams recieve one point for scoring into the bottom port, two points for the outer port, and three for the inner port.
        Another way to earn match points is by spinning the <b>Control Panel</b> at the correct time, recieving 10 points for
        rotation control and 20 points for position control. During the last 30 seconds of the match, also called <b>"endgame,"</b>
        robots move to the <b>Shield Generator</b> to climb. Alliances recieve five points for parking, 25 points for each robot
        hanging, and an additional 15 points if the switch is balenced. <b>The alliance with the most match points when the match ends wins!</b>
      </p>
      <p class="big_indent">
        <b><u>RANKING POINTS</u></b>
      </p>
      <p class="big_indent pl-3">
        Ranking points determine a team’s <b>overall place</b> in the qualification matches. They can be earned by
        <b>completing three stages to energize the Shield Generator</b> (see number 3), receiving <b>65 or more endgame points</b> from climbing,
        and <b>winning</b> or <b>tying</b> a match. There is a max of <b>four ranking points</b> available each game.

      <p class="big_indent">
        If a rocket ship has <strong>6 hatch panels and 6 cargo</strong>, it is considered completed. A completed rocket ship
        counts for one ranking point.

          4. Some Robots Can Climb
        </strong>
      </h4>
      <p class="big_indent">
        If an alliance has robots on the <strong>first and third</strong> platforms or <strong>two on the second and one on the
          first</strong>, they earn a ranking point. They also earn match points for climbing, which can help them win the match.

      <p class="big_indent">
        Two alliances play in every match: <span style="color:red">red</span> and <span style="color:blue">blue</span>.
        <strong>Each alliance during qualifications contains three randomly-selected teams.</strong> After qualifications, the
        top eight ranked teams choose alliances to compete with for eliminations.

          6. Teams Can Receive Penalties That Award Points to the Opposing Alliance
        </strong>
      </h4>
      <p class="big_indent">
        There are six penalties a team can make during a match. Usually, a referee will wave his or her flag to signal a penalty.
        Depending on the type a penalty, <strong>referees will award a certain number of match points to the opposing
        alliance</strong>.

      <p class="big_indent">
          Numbers and icons of <strong>teams</strong> are shown on the side as well as their <strong>rank</strong> and whether they went <strong>up or down</strong> in the ranking.

      <p class="big_indent">
        <strong><u>TOTALS</u></strong>
      </p>
      <p class="big_indent">
        The <strong>total score</strong> of each alliance is conveyed in the middle, and it specifies which team won. <strong>Ranking point totals</strong> are shown in the bottom corners. There are icons below the totals symbolizing the different ways to earn a ranking point, and if the icons are highlighted, the team has scored that point.
      </p>
      <p class="big_indent">
        <strong><u>POINT BREAKDOWNS</u></strong>
      </p>
      <p class="big_indent">
        At the bottom of the scoreboard, <strong>point breakdowns</strong> are shown. This specifies points for <strong>each section of the game</strong> as well as penalties of the other team. These points are <strong>added up</strong> for each <strong>team’s total score.</strong> In <strong>Quarterfinals</strong> and later, the scoreboard looks slightly different, as shown in the right image. <strong>Ranking points are not counted in these matches,</strong> so the bottom corners will only show the trophy icon. <strong>Individual team ranking is also not recorded,</strong> so the ranking next to the team is not there.

          9. Visit the Pits to Chat With Teams and Collect Buttons

      <p class="big_indent">
        The pits are the area where teams keep their tools and work on their robots in between matches. If you want to check them out, ask your student to show you the way. <strong>Don’t forget to pick up a pair of safety glasses at the entrance!</strong> Also, most teams will give out buttons at their pit, so you can start a collection.

        </strong>
      </h4>
      <div class="big_indent">
        <p>
          KnightKrawler cheers are used in the stands. One person will lead them, usually the mascot, and you can follow along! When you hear the words, respond with the <b>bold</b> ones.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>20! <b>52!</b></li>
          <li>Let Me Hear You Holler! <b>KnightKrawler</b>!</li>
          <li><b>Deep Down in Robotics Jungle You Can Hear KnightKrawler Rumble: Hoo Ha… Hoo Ha!</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We have cheers aimed at the entire alliance as well, not just our team. This is cheered in the same rhythm as the “let’s go (team)” cheer in baseball.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Red Alliance *five claps*</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In addition to these cheers, KnightKrawler likes to cheer for our alliance partners, especially in eliminations. These cheers will be the same as KnightKrawler’s “2052” cheer, but with the other team’s numbers instead of ours.
