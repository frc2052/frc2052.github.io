        </b>
      </h4>
      <p class="big_indent">
        During the <b>first 15 seconds of every match</b>, drivers are required to keep away from the driver stations as their
        robots drive with <b>pre-programmed</b> code. This year, robots start the game on the <b>opposite end of the field from
        their driver stations</b>. Keep an eye out for robots that score all their power cells (balls) during autonomous — this can
        give teams a head start before the teleoperated (driver controlled) portion of the match.

          2. Robots Can Score Match Points and Ranking Points
        </b>
      </h4>
      <p class="big_indent">
        <b><u>MATCH POINTS</u></b>
      </p>
      <p class="big_indent pl-3">
        During Autonomous, robots can earn points for <b>moving from the "Initiation Line.”</b> At all times during the match,
        robots attempt to score <b>balls called “power cells”</b> into the Power Port located at the opposite side of the
        field. Teams recieve one point for scoring into the bottom port, two points for the outer port, and three for the inner port.
        Another way to earn match points is by spinning the <b>Control Panel</b> at the correct time, recieving 10 points for
        rotation control and 20 points for position control. During the last 30 seconds of the match, also called <b>"endgame,"</b>
        robots move to the <b>Shield Generator</b> to climb. Alliances recieve five points for parking, 25 points for each robot
        hanging, and an additional 15 points if the switch is balenced. <b>The alliance with the most match points when the match ends wins!</b>
      </p>
      <p class="big_indent">
        <b><u>RANKING POINTS</u></b>
      </p>
      <p class="big_indent pl-3">
        Ranking points determine a team’s <b>overall place</b> in the qualification matches. They can be earned by
        <b>completing three stages to energize the Shield Generator</b> (see number 3), receiving <b>65 or more endgame points</b> from climbing,
        and <b>winning</b> or <b>tying</b> a match. There is a max of <b>four ranking points</b> available to each alliance every game.

          3. Watch For Shield Generator Stages
        </strong>
      </h4>
      <p class="big_indent">
        <b>Alliances recieve a ranking point</b> if they complete three Shield Generator stages. The first one requires nine power cells to be scored and
        the autonomous period to end. Stage two is completed when twenty additional power cells are scored and a <b>spinner called the "Control Panel"</b>
        is spun three to five times. Finally, the third stage is activated when another twenty power cells are scored and the Control Panel is spun
        to a specific color.

          4. Some Robots Can Hang
        </strong>
      </h4>
      <p class="big_indent">
        If an alliance has <b>two hanging robots and the Generator Switch is level</b> or <b>three hanging robots,</b> they earn a ranking point. They also
        earn match points for hanging on or parking under the switch, which can help them win the match.

          5. Two Alliances Made of Three Teams Play at Every Match

      </h4>
      <p class="big_indent">
        Two alliances play in every match: <span style="color:red">red</span> and <span style="color:blue">blue</span>.
        <strong>Each alliance during qualifications contains three randomly-selected teams.</strong> After qualifications, the
        top eight ranked teams choose alliances to compete with for eliminations.

          6. Teams Can Receive Penalties That Award Points to the Opposing Alliance
        </strong>
      </h4>
      <p class="big_indent">
        Teams can make penalties during a match for certain illegal actions. Usually, a referee will wave his or her flag to signal a penalty.
        Depending on the type a penalty, <strong>referees will award a certain number of match points to the opposing
        alliance</strong>.

          9. Visit the Pits to Chat With Teams and Collect Buttons
        </strong>
      </h4>
      <p class="big_indent">
        The pits are the area where teams keep their tools and work on their robots in between matches. If you want to check them out,
        ask an FRC student to show you the way. <strong>Don’t forget to pick up a pair of safety glasses at the entrance!</strong> Also,
        most teams will give out buttons at their pit, so you can start a collection.

          10. Cheer With KnightKrawler!
        </strong>
      </h4>
      <div class="big_indent">
        <p>
          KnightKrawler cheers are used in the stands. One person will lead them, usually the mascot, and you can follow along! When you
          hear the words, respond with the <b>bold</b> ones.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>20! <b>52!</b></li>
          <li>Let Me Hear You Holler! <b>KnightKrawler</b>!</li>
          <li><b>Deep Down in Robotics Jungle You Can Hear KnightKrawler Rumble: Hoo Ha… Hoo Ha!</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We have cheers aimed at the entire alliance as well, not just our team. This is cheered in the same rhythm as the “let’s go (team)”
          cheer in baseball.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Red Alliance *five claps*</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In addition to these cheers, KnightKrawler likes to cheer for our alliance partners, especially in eliminations. These cheers will
          be the same as KnightKrawler’s “2052” cheer, but with other teams' numbers instead of ours.
