      KnightKrawler has an "official" season that starts at <a href="/glossary#infonight" target="_blank">Information Night</a>
      and ends after our last competition.  The last competition could be a regional in March or April, Championships (late April), or the State Tournament (mid-May).
      </p>
      <p>
        We officially meet 11 months of the year.  The mentors attempt to take a one month break for most of June.
        Optional meetings are typically held 1-2 days per week in the summer where students can work on special projects.
        These include, but are not limited to, building a new drive mechanism the team has not tried before or programming an <a href="/glossary#autonomous" target="_blank">autonomous</a> routine.
        The team also does various outreach activities during the summer that students are encouraged, but not required, to attend.

            During offseason, we attend <a href="/glossary#minnemini" target="_blank">Minne Mini</a> and the
            <a href="/glossary#mri" target="_blank">Minnesota Robotics Invitational</a>. These take place in the fall and use the previous season's game to introduce new students to FIRST Robotics.
          </p>

            We also attend two regular-season competitions in Minnesota; the Northern Lights Regional in
            Duluth and the Minnesota 10,000 Lakes Regional in Minneapolis. If we qualify for
            <a href="/glossary#champs" target="_blank">FIRST Championships</a>, we take a trip to Detroit, Michigan in April.
            We can also qualify for the Minnesota state competition, which is in May.

            While robotics is a large time commitment, it is possible to participate in other activities.
            Fall and Spring activities typically work best with the robotics season. Our Build Season is
            in January, which makes it difficult, but still possible, to do a winter sport/activity and robotics. Also, robotics
            meetings start later in the night, at 6:00 pm, so clubs and other activities right after school can work.
            If you have more questions, talk to or <a href="/contact" target="_blank">email</a> our team advisor at <a href="/glossary#infonight" target="_blank">Information Night</a>.

            No! <a href="/glossary#infonight" target="_blank">Information Night</a> is usually held the last week of September and new students
            can begin attending meetings that week. Students do not need to commit to the team until the end of October, when the
            first activity fee payment is due. This offers a "free trial period" to students that are unsure if they want to join
            our team. During this month, students play icebreaker games to get to know eachother and have the chance to rotate
            through our three <a href="/glossary#subteams" target="_blank">subteams</a> to get a feel for which one they might want to join.

            Our required annual budget is usually between $50,000 and $75,000, depending on team size and if we qualify for
            the <a href="/glossary#champs" target="_blank">championship</a> tournament in Detroit (we have the past 6 years).
            Most of this budget is funded by our generous sponsors, and Irondale High School pays for two of our busses to
            competitions. The rest is paid by our students' activity registration fee, which is <strong>$200-$250 per person</strong>.
            At the end of October, when students officially sign up to join the team, they can choose to pay the fee all at once or throughout the
            course of the year. Out-of-town competitions are not included in this fee. Those cost an <strong>additional $150-$200 each</strong>.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p class="maroon">
            <strong>NOTE</strong>: Irondale has an "activity cap" which allows students who are in multiple activities to only pay for one.
            Unfortunately, <strong>this cap does NOT apply to robotics</strong>, meaning that students will have to pay the
            registration fee regardless of participation in other Irondale activities.

            A few months before <a href="/glossary#buildseason" target="_blank">build season</a>, mentors will hand out "point sheets" to
            students. These papers are used to keep track of student involvement in the team and a specific amount is
            required to attend competitions. <strong>Students can also recieve a Varsity Letter from Irondale</strong> for recieving 20 or
            more points throughout the year. Points can be earned in three categories: team (for attending competitions),
            outreach (for attending outreach events), and subteam (for completing a significant
            <a href="/glossary#subteams" target="_blank">subteam</a> task).
