      KnightKrawler has an "official" season that starts at <a href="/glossary#infonight">Information Night</a>
      and ends after our last competition.  The last competition could be a regional in March or April, Championships (late April), or the State Tournament (mid-May).
      </p>
      <p>
        We officially meet 11 months of the year.  The mentors attempt to take a one month break for most of June.
        Optional meetings are typically held 1-2 days per week in the summer where students can work on special projects.
        These include, but are not limited to, building a new drive mechanism the team has not tried before or programming an <a href="/glossary#autonomous">autonomous</a> routine.
        The team also does various outreach activities during the summer that students are encouraged, but not required, to attend.

            During offseason, we attend <a href="/glossary#minnemini">Minne Mini</a> and the
            <a href="/glossary#mri">Minnesota Robotics Invitational</a>. These take place in the fall and use the previous season's game to introduce new students to FIRST Robotics.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also attend two regular season events in Minnesota. If we qualify for <a href="/glossary#champs">FIRST Championships</a> we take a trip to Detroit, Michigan in April.
            We can also qualify for the Minnesota state competition, which is in May.
