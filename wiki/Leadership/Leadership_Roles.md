Captain candidates interview for a *team* leadership position. Students are able to indicate preferences based on current leadership roles (e.g. full team captain, strategy captain, programming subteam captain, build subteam captain), and may be encouraged to fill another position based on their strengths and team needs. Similarly, student strengths and team needs may create a new leadership position previously not advertised. No student is forced to take an undesired leadership position, and the team benefits from having a variety of student leadership strengths and perspectives.

Occasionally, two candidates may be selected to be co-captains (e.g. build subteam co-captains). KnightKrawler avoids putting two students together as co-captains unless both agree they can work well together. Such scenarios include when there are two ideal candidates or when two candidates have complementary strengths.

The role descriptions above are general, as each student leader has brought their own unique skills and strengths to the role. Please reach out to a mentor or current captain if you have questions about any of the descriptions listed. Current student leaders are also a wonderful resource of information on what each role entails.
