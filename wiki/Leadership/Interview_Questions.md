## Programming Captain Candidates:

* How effective is our current fall training? How would you like to see it change?

* How well have we balanced the workload between subteam members, and how would you help manage the balance?

* In the last half of the competition season, we usually run out of work for everyone except 1 or 2 programmers. Do you have suggestions on ways to keep all members busy?

* Please give an example of a time when you included one or more less experienced team members in a more difficult task.

* What are the roles and responsibilities for the programming team in regard to the robot/game?  (What do you feel they are currently and should they change?) 

## Build Captain Candidates:

* How well have we balanced the workload between subteam members, and how would you help manage the balance?

* Please give an example of a time when you included one or more less experienced team members in a more difficult task.

## Media Captain Candidates:

* How well have we balanced the workload between subteam members, and how would you help manage the balance?

* Please give an example of a time when you included one or more less experienced team members in a more difficult task. How do you (plan to) keep all members of the team engaged?

* What missing skills or tools do you feel are most needed for the media task force? Do you have ideas of how to gain those skills or tools for the team?

* How much do you feel the media task force should be involved in the robot design process, and how much should media members know about the robot’s capabilities?

## Team Captain Candidates:

* As a general rule, do you believe the Team Captain should participate in a primary subteam to help work on assigned tasks, or should spread themselves across all sub-teams to help when/where needed, but not be responsible for specific jobs?  Why?

* What do you believe will be the most challenging 2 or 3 things you will need to deal with as team captain, and how do you plan to address those changes?

## Strategy Lead Candidates:

* Strategy captain is a role that often requires you to work alone, but then at other times with the whole team. Often there is nothing to do, at other times such as alliance selection, your job may be very critical. How do you feel about being in this unique role?

* What do you think is key to being a great strategy captain?

* If the team captain does not want to be on the field for alliance selection, is this a job you are comfortable doing?
