# Accounting

## Overview

Accounting, budgeting, forecasting, and taxes can be hard, especially if you are new to keeping the books. This training series will cover everything you need to know to get started in keeping the books for your non-profit organization. We will cover:

* Setting up Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel  
* Creating a Budget  
* Tracking Expenses  
* Tracking Sponsorship and Fundraising  
* Tracking Student Payments  
* Using a Credit Card and Paypal  
* Handling Payments from Sponsors Sent Directly to FIRST  
* Adjusting Budget Projections Mid-Year  
* Reporting and Protecting Student Privacy  
* Tax Preparation

By the end of this series, you will have set up a complete accounting system for your organization. You will be able to track all bank, credit card and paypal transactions. You'll track everything against your budget. Your summary reports will automatically update every time you enter a transaction and multiple double checks will help you avoid mistakes. You'll be able to track all student fees and do so in a way that protects student privacy. Finally you'll have an easy way to fill out page 1 of the IRS tax form 990EZ, with advice and recommendations for completing the necessary tax schedules that go with it. If you are like many non-profit organizations that lack a steady revenue stream, the question "How are we doing?" can be very difficult to answer. This accounting system can help you answer those difficult questions and keep your team in good financial shape.

### Updates Since Recordings

KnightKrawler changed the fiscal year end from September 30 to June 30\. Changing the year end to June was done for the following reasons: 

* Allows for accounts to be settled/reconciled at a time of the year when financial activity is lowest  
* Allows fundraising and sponsorship for next fiscal year to start before school starts, when students are more available during business hours.  
* Taxes are not due in the middle of build season (Nov 15 vs Feb 15\)  
* Allows for budget meeting before school starts  
* Better aligns spending with team student leadership changes

501c3 organizations are allowed to change their fiscal year once every 10 years without extra paperwork. On your filing, set your Fiscal Year start to the previous start (Oct 1 in our case) and set the fiscal year end to the new end (June 30 in our case). The accounting software should detect this is a truncated year filing and prompt you to indicate if this is a business termination filing, or a change of fiscal year filing. There isn’t a checkbox on the form (as of 2025\) to indicate a change of filing year. Changing your fiscal year will always result in a 3, 6, or 9 month filing. You cannot for example wait 3 extra months to file a 15 month tax form. You must file a 3 month, then your normal 12 month annual filing for the new fiscal year.

KnightKrawler changed our fee structure pertaining to travel. See the Wiki article **Season Structure and Fees**.

For budgetary purposes, travel donation income is estimated to be 65% of estimated costs for Regional 1, and 20% of estimated costs for Champs. As a result the team must use fundraising and sponsorship to make up roughly $4,000 in travel costs for Regional 1, and $28,000 in costs for Champs travel (if the whole team travels to champs). Travel donations have been slightly restructured in our new budgeting process, compared to the video. However because travel costs are such a significant part of the budget, we still maintain summary rows in our budget to compare travel vs non-travel expenses.
