    KnightKrawler students and mentors developed a building and programming class/camp for <b>Raspberry Pi robots</b>.
    The goal of this project is to show students how <b>easy it is to create a simple robot</b>.
    We also wanted the project to be something <b>students can easily create from home</b>.
    These robots are <b>cheap to build</b> and are programmed in <b>Python</b> on a <b>Raspberry Pi</b> computer.
    Two or more robots with a push pin in the front and ballon in the back can make for a fun battle setup where each robot attempts to pop the ballon of the other robots.

    After we decided how we wanted to build our robots, we put together 15 kits to bring to our classes when we teach them.
    The instruction guide (linked below) contains a complete list of the parts included in our kits and links to purchase them.
    It will also walk you through the step-by-step process of assembling, wiring, and programming your robot.
