**KnightKrawler 3D Printer Checkout and Liability Agreement**

It is the responsibility of the person or people utilizing loaned KnightKrawler 3D printers to ensure that all possible precautions are taken to avoid injury to people or damage to the devices borrowed. Please ensure that the following safety instructions are followed: 

1. To check out a printer the student must complete the Onshape training modules the mentors deem necessary and must complete the necessary training for use of the slicer software and printer.  
2. The 3D printer checked out during the YEAR RANGE should only be used within a student’s home. No one outside of those whose names are on this agreement should be using the equipment at any time.  
3. The 3D printer checked out during the YEAR RANGE season is not to be tampered with or opened/disassembled in any way. This includes firmware updates. Please consult MENTOR (EMAIL) before downloading updates.  
4. Responsibility for the equipment remains with the student borrowing from the moment of pick-up to the moment of drop-off  
5. Any malfunctions or damages to equipment must be reported promptly to MENTOR (EMAIL) with a description of the damage or malfunction, printer name/number, and a photo (if applicable). MENTOR will facilitate a plan to take back, repair, return, or replace equipment. No one outside of the robotics mentors should attempt to repair, replace parts of, or disassemble the printer checked out. Students and outside personnel are prohibited from performing these actions.  
6. The student checking out the 3D printer must join the **\#3dprinter** Slack channel to monitor requests to bring the printer back to the shop or other instructions.

If damage to equipment is determined to be caused by negligence or abuse, the family may be asked to reimburse the team for repair or replacement. This will also apply to equipment that is not returned. A student may be unable to receive replacement equipment or participate in certain team activities if fees are not paid.

All efforts should be made to maintain equipment in its same condition (ordinary wear and tear accepted) it was checked out for the YEAR RANGE season. If you have any issues with using the programs on your computer, please contact your subteam captains and mentors.

I agree with the above terms.
