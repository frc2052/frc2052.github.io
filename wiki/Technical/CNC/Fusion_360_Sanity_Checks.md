# Sanity Checks

* Will the tool unintentionally collide with stock?  
* If the toolpath will cause part to be disconnected from stock, is part held down by screws/stock hold downs?  
* Will the tool collide with any screws/stock hold-downs?  
* Is the machine Z-Axis zeroed with the current tool?  
* **DO NOT PLUNGE WITHOUT VERIFICATION BY EXPERIENCED CAM STUDENT OR MENTOR**

## If you are going above these values you need verification and supervision by an experienced CAM student or CAM mentor
