# Reveal Video Production

KnightKrawler has performed a review of past reveal videos, including a “plusses and deltas” review of each video. The purpose of this guide is to show the different approaches that have been taken over many years, highlight the things that worked well and things that can be improved in the future. See each video analysis below the recommendations.  
 

## General Observations

* Know your audience. The Reveal Video isn’t for KnightKrawler students. It is for other teams who are scouting our robot. It is a commercial for the robot. Show it off. Make something people want to share.  
* A variety of shots impresses. Shots from on top of a ladder looking down or from carpet looking up are cool. Show close ups of the moving parts and blinky lights. Show the wires and hoses. Close up shots of the game pieces entering, leaving and moving through the robot are cool.   
* Use a tripod as often as possible for steady shots. Setup shots so you don’t have to pan/move the camera. Have the robot drive towards the camera for interesting shots. When using phone video, shoot all video in landscape.  
* Hiding the endgame strategy/mechanism used to be fun/cool, but with so much design on open alliance, it is now more important to show the best part of your robot for scouting. Show the really hard stuff your robot can do in detail (Example: 2022 End Game).   
* Showing students prototyping is great, but only for a small part of the video, focus on the end product. Consider putting most student shots in a recap video, rather than the reveal video.  
* Put the sponsors in the beginning of the video. Mark says, “Business in the front, party in the back”.  
* Get shots of the robot moving fast, not slow. Ask for the drivers to repeat something until you get the shot you want. Direct the driver on what to do for the shot. Setup the shot, get close.  
* Avoid shots of the robot performing badly or failing at a task unless it is intentionally (and obviously) used to show progression of a working mechanism.  
* Groups of shots are popular. 4 shots of shooting from different angles, 3 shots of driving over obstacles, 3 shots of game piece acquisition, 2 shots of climbing. Stack these shots together and show the robot working from a variety of angles. For example, highlight the indexer with multiple shots, then move on to the group of shooter videos.  
* When considering music, think about how moments in the song can correlate to moments in the video.

## Planning Ahead for Rapid Production

* Timelines for completing the reveal video are always short. Often students may only have 1 day from the time they capture their last shots until the final video is needed.   
* Create your video project ahead of time in Davinci, Premier Pro, CapCut, Final Cut Pro, Camtasia, or your video editor of choice  
* Establish a shot by shot timeline before any work is started.  
* Add all elements of the video as soon as possible. Title screens, sponsors, etc, can all be completed and added to a video before the robot is built.  
* Put in placeholder videos when planning. Take a photo/video of someone holding a piece of paper that says “climbing”. Take a video of someone walking as if the robot is driving to establish timing of clips. Complete the entire video to desired length with place holder videos. Then replace the place holder videos with real clips as they are collected.  
* When planning your video, plan to stack mechanism shots in groups. It is ok to repeat groups such as 3 shooting, 3 game piece acquisition, 2 shooting, 4 driving, 3 game piece holding,  3 shooting, 3 climbing.  
* Know what videos you need to shoot before the robot is complete. Work with programmers and the drive team to capture the clips you need. Great clips can often be captured during autonomous testing because the robot will drive specific paths and use specific mechanisms allowing for planning your shots around knowing exactly where the robot will be.  
* Pick a music track as an adequate soundtrack for your video before starting shooting. Do not hold up video production to look for music. Look for better music only after no more video production can be done, or in periods where you are waiting to capture better shots. Some music has dramatic pauses or suspenseful lead-ins that can enhance the video. Look for these only after you have the video you want, then tweak the timeline to fit as time permits.
