# MinneTrials Overview

MinneTrials is a simplified FRC Game. The game was originally started by Team 3100 Lightning Turtles. In subsequent years, Team 2239 Technocrats took the lead role on organizing the event, in partnership with 2491 NoMythic and 2450 Wind Chill. Team 2491 NoMythic has taken the lead organizer role in 2025\.

The event started as “Turtle Trials”, was renamed “The Test” and is now called “MinneTrials”

The game uses FRC kitbot chassis (or a comparable chassis of similar cost). The total cost (original purchase price) of all parts on the robot is limited to keep competition fair and is comparable to what it would cost to build the KitBot this year. 

The game is designed for a half field and is played with 2 alliances of 2 robots each.

A FRC style game manual is released that is very similar to an official FRC game manual to give students some familiarity with reading through a game manual.

The robots are often of a simple design, many with only a single mechanism with a single motor. Often mechanisms are made from plywood, 2x4s, and cardboard.

Some teams have used MinneTrials to learn fabrication and only make parts from aluminum and polycarbonate.

The official release of the MinneTrials game manual is typically the first week in October. Some teams have waited before starting MinneTrials to purposely compress the schedule to give the “6 weeks” experience.
