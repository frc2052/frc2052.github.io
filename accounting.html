    <p>Accounting, budgeting, forecasting, and taxes can be hard, especially if you are new to keeping the books. 
        In this training series will will cover everything you need to know to get started in keeping the books for your non-profit organization.
        We will cover:    
        <ul>

          <li>Creating a Budget</li>

      </p>
      <p>
      By the end of this series, you will have setup a complete accounting system for your organization. You will be able to track all bank, credit card and paypal transactions.
      You'll track everything against your budget. Your summary reports will automatically update everytime you enter a transaction and multiple double checks will help you 
      avoid mistakes. You'll be able to track all student fees and do so in a way that protects student privacy. Finally you'll have an easy way to fill out page 1 of the 
      IRS tax form 990EZ, with advice and recommendations for completing the neccessary tax schedules that go with it.  If you are like many non-profit organizations
      that lack a steady revenue stream, the question "How are we doing?" can be very difficult to answer. This accounting system can help you answer those difficult questions
      and keep your team in good financial shape.
