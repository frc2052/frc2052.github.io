    Recently, KnightKrawler students and mentors developed a building and programming class for <b>Raspberry Pi robots</b>.
    The goal of this project is to show students how <b>easy it is to create a simple robot</b>.
    We also wanted the project to be something <b>students can easily create from home</b>.
    These robots are <b>cheap to build</b> and are programmed in <b>Python</b> on a <b>Raspberry Pi</b> computer.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
    After we decided how we wanted to build our robots, we put together 15 kits to bring to our classes when we teach them.
    The instruction guide (linked below) contains a complete list of the parts included in our kits and links to purchase them.
    It will also walk you through the step-by-step process of assembling, wiring, and programming your robot.
