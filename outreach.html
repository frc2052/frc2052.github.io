          </h2>
          <p>KnightKrawler partners with local Girl Scout troops to provide hands-on STEM activities and robotics 
             demonstrations. We host workshops where Girl Scouts can learn about engineering principles, programming, 
             and teamwork. Our goal is to inspire young girls to pursue interests in science and technology, and to 
             empower them with the skills and confidence to succeed in these fields. Learn more by visiting our 
             <a href="/girlscouts/"><strong>Girl Scouts</strong></a> page!</p>
