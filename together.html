        Do you have a 3D printer? We received a huge shipment of .01" (10 mil) PETG super clear sheets from our sponsor 3M. This is enough to make over 11,000 face shields. We can only 3D print about 1,200 visors per week.
        Together, we can put thousands more face shields into the hands of people who desperately  need them before Minnesota hits the COVID-19 peak. If you have the ability to 3D print visors at 
        home, work, or school, but cannot find or afford face shield plastic, we can help each other.

            As of Monday April 13, we need 2,500 more visors to fulfill our order backlog, which is growing every day.  You can help us fulfill these orders, or we can help you fill the need you have identified.
            Either way, working together we can make a bigger impact than working alone. We are currently running our printers 8am to 6pm, Monday through Saturday. If you want to pick up or drop off
            please email covid19@team2052.com, tweet us at Team2052, or send us a Facebook message. If you are picking up shields, we'll need to know how many you need before you come. Currently we have 3,000 
            pieces cut, hole-punched, and ready to go.

            We have <a href="https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-9nntib/images/stencil/1280x1280/products/61915/190089/Rubber-Band-Sizing-Chart_2017_FINAL_RT-2__22289__18225.1560967206.jpg?c=2&imbypass=on&fbclid=IwAR0QfvmzbmUyuc6hoIdXEqHrhQkJy5235pfBeOb2jM7CkYX1-sbugFUONso" target="_blank">#33 rubber bands</a> 
            for use with this visor. If you are printing a different type of visor (must work with a 3-hole punch shield) that requires a longer rubber band or visor strap, 
            please include a headband that works with your visor, if you are dropping off.

            If you want to help, but your printer is too small to print a visor, you can create ear savers for us to distribute. There are many designs available. Feel free to find the design you think works best.
